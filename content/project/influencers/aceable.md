# Aceable

Aceable, a popular provider of online driver's education, added me to their team of freelancers to execute content strategy. [Aceable's driver's ed app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aceable.aceablede_android&hl=en_US) is a top seller on the Apple Store and has a 4.9 star rating. 

The company offers information on driving safety, especially on the dangers of distracted driving. Driving while texting is a growing cause of injury and death on the road. 

I pitched stories featuring YouTube content creators who would be relatable to their Generation Z audience. Safety messages need not be preachy to be effective. Then, I pitched several YouTubers how a respected brand could widen their audience. 

The company adopted the idea of using interviews as a way to connect to young people and their parents.
